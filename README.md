## Introduction
Logfiles made by an instance of a multi-time-graph can be viewed using the multi-time-graph-reader. The reader allows the selection of any previous session and any file within that session

## Future versions
Hovering over the graph now only shows the position on the x scale (a.k.a. time) but the values of the individual graphs at that point could be shown as well.
